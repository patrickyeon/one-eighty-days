    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A smaller release today: Romotive ran a kickstarter campaign for our then-new Romo Gen3 product. At the time we were all working, eating, and hanging out in a couple apartments in the Ogden (contrary to some of the press, there were more apartments than just those two so that we could get a bit of personal space, and bedrooms). I quickly threw together <a href="https://github.com/patrickyeon/kickding">kickding.py</a> to give out a little Romo &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; every time we got a new backer at a tier that earned them a robot.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never scraped a web page before, just know that <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> is your best friend. I&rsquo;ve done a few projects that required scraping, and it has been a godsend whether throwing together something quick like this or getting a lot more data out of a web site for a heavier project.</p>

<p>Hopefully some day data will be more readily available through APIs or at least more machine-readable sources. I do often find myself wishing there was an easy way to access the data source backing some documents, and I fear there will be much more scraping and data extraction in my future. At least if I start releasing the tools, even the simple hacks, I write for this, I can hope to save somebody else the trouble down the line.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As promised, my first release is up at <a href="http://github.com/patrickyeon/arduinolibs/">http://github.com/patrickyeon/arduinolibs/</a>. It&rsquo;s a library for working with <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/ina3221">TI&rsquo;s INA3221</a> current and voltage measurent IC, a chip that I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with so far, even if it acted a weirdly in our intern&rsquo;s project (I think the problem arose from having current sense resistors, and their measurement channels, in series). His project is the third internal board we&rsquo;ve got this puppy on <a href="http://romotive.com">at work</a>, and I&rsquo;ll probably keep on slapping them down whenever I need a quick-and-easy current measurement.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>180 Releases, 180 Days. Getting started.</h2>

<p>Jennifer Dewalt is <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180">building 180 websites in 180 days</a>, and absolutely killing it. Derek Sivers has a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6097663">good comment</a> on producing work as an artist on the related Hacker News page. It&rsquo;s a recurring theme in Sivers&#8217; blog posts: you need to get out and ship. Seth Godin says it a lot too: &ldquo;Real artists ship&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Jennifer&rsquo;s powering away on that by blocking off 10 hours a day to produce a new idea and learn everything it takes her to pull it off. I won&rsquo;t commit to 10 hours a day, but I <em>do</em> want to do something similar. So here&rsquo;s my version:</p>

<p>One hundred and eighty days. One release a day. No days off.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;release&rdquo; is a completely subjective measurement, I&rsquo;ll just say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know it when I see it&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not promising to create something new each day, in fact my initial drive is to ship a number of small projects I&rsquo;ve dicked around with and keep on telling myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just clean this up later and then put it online&rdquo;. But any release will be something I haven&rsquo;t put out there before. I&rsquo;m making my own set of rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every release is available for free (as in beer) and linked to with a blog post. (Furthermore, I expect the majority of my stuff will be released under a free software or creative commons-like license.)</li>
<li>Every release will be the product of some respectable amount of work. One-liners, simple photos, and quickly-written posts are not enough.</li>
<li>If I don&rsquo;t release something and publish a blog post between 12:01 AM and 11:59 PM (PST), that day&rsquo;s missed and I start over at day 1.</li>
<li>I can quit when I&rsquo;ve successfully hit 180 days in a row.</li>
</ul>


<p>These rules are more flexible than Jennifer&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m not restricting myself to one medium, but again she&rsquo;s beasting through this and I&rsquo;m just trying to spur myself into a little more action. I trust that I&rsquo;ll be hard enough on myself to keep the bar high enough and not phone it in any days just to keep a streak going.</p>

<p>Today is day one. This is not the first release, but the next post will be.</p>
