    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A smaller release today: Romotive ran a kickstarter campaign for our then-new Romo Gen3 product. At the time we were all working, eating, and hanging out in a couple apartments in the Ogden (contrary to some of the press, there were more apartments than just those two so that we could get a bit of personal space, and bedrooms). I quickly threw together <a href="https://github.com/patrickyeon/kickding">kickding.py</a> to give out a little Romo &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; every time we got a new backer at a tier that earned them a robot.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never scraped a web page before, just know that <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> is your best friend. I&rsquo;ve done a few projects that required scraping, and it has been a godsend whether throwing together something quick like this or getting a lot more data out of a web site for a heavier project.</p>

<p>Hopefully some day data will be more readily available through APIs or at least more machine-readable sources. I do often find myself wishing there was an easy way to access the data source backing some documents, and I fear there will be much more scraping and data extraction in my future. At least if I start releasing the tools, even the simple hacks, I write for this, I can hope to save somebody else the trouble down the line.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As promised, my first release is up at <a href="http://github.com/patrickyeon/arduinolibs/">http://github.com/patrickyeon/arduinolibs/</a>. It&rsquo;s a library for working with <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/ina3221">TI&rsquo;s INA3221</a> current and voltage measurent IC, a chip that I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with so far, even if it acted a weirdly in our intern&rsquo;s project (I think the problem arose from having current sense resistors, and their measurement channels, in series). His project is the third internal board we&rsquo;ve got this puppy on <a href="http://romotive.com">at work</a>, and I&rsquo;ll probably keep on slapping them down whenever I need a quick-and-easy current measurement.</p>
